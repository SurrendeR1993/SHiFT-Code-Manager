SHiFT Code-Manager written by SurrendeR1993.	Version: 1.1

-------------
---General---
-------------
This tool will help you to automatically redeem all available Vault Insider Program & SHiFT - Codes for all "Borderlands"-games.
Use at your own risk. I am not responsible for any negative consequences. The program is provided "as-is".

--------------
---SECURITY---
--------------
The tool can save login data on request (e-mail address, password).
These are stored locally only slightly encrypted. Therefore, use on public PCs is not recommended, as long as the data is saved.

------------
-----FAQ----
------------
#The tool reports that the server does not accept the request. What can I do?
Sometimes, especially on the first pass of SHiFT codes, 2k blocks communication after a few requests. When this happens, wait a while and try again. SHiFT Code-Manager saves all previously tried codes.

#Are my login credentials safe? What data is used and where are they sent?
The tool only communicates with 2k and Orcicorn's servers with cURL. Your data will only be sent to 2k with https. This includes session information and cookies.
Alwas quit the tool by pressing the 'x'. Only then you will be logged out and your session will be invalid.

---THANKS---
------------
A big thank you goes to Orcicorn. Without his fantastic help and extremely good work, I would not have a reliable source for the codes and a good alpha tester.
Leave him a big thank you on Twitter! https://twitter.com/orcicorn

Another big thank you goes to Micha for the incentive and the assistance if I had no more desire :D
